abstract: In the last decade, OCR progress has triggered a massive trend towards the digitisation of legacy documents, with several Digital Humanities projects exploring means for structuring retro-digitised dictionaries. However there is a lack of awareness of the impact of the OCRs quality on the information extraction process. In this work, we shed light on the relationship between these two steps through experiments carried out with a TEI-based system for automatic parsing of dictionaries.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We explore the impact of the OCR quality on grobid-dictionaries models.
