abstract: We introduce the first treebank for a romanized user-generated content variety of Algerian, a North-African Arabic dialect. Made of 1500 sentences, fully annotated in morpho-syntax and Universal Dependency syntax, with full translation at both the word and the sentence levels, this treebank is made freely available. It is supplemented with 50k. unlabeled sentences collected from Common Crawl and web-crawled data using intensive data-mining techniques. Preliminary experiments demonstrate its usefulness for POS tagging and dependency parsing.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
